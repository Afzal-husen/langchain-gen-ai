Supported model providers: OpenAI, Anthropic

A simple 'needle in a haystack' analysis to test in-context retrieval ability of long context LLMs.

Get the behind the scenes on the [overview video](https://youtu.be/KwRRuiCCdmc).

![GPT-4-128 Context Testing](img/NeedleHaystackCodeSnippet.png)

git clone https://github.com/gkamradt/LLMTest_NeedleInAHaystack.git

## The Test
1. Place a random fact or statement (the 'needle') in the middle of a long context window (the 'haystack')
2. Ask the model to retrieve this statement
3. Iterate over various document depths (where the needle is placed) and context lengths to measure performance
